YH-KJWHKQ_0,"1. Trump - “Take a look at what I was left with. The impression that Mister Trump left me we have an economy of the regional economy collapsed. New challenge. Unemployment rate rose to 15% is terrible.” (False - While unemployment did rise significantly during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is misleading to attribute the entire state of the economy solely to Trump's actions without acknowledging the effects of the pandemic.)

2. Trump - “The only jobs he created it for illegal immigrants and bounce back jobs to bounce back from the Covid. He has not done a good job.” (False - This statement lacks context. Job creation has occurred post-COVID, though the quality and types of jobs created can vary and are subject to debate. Claiming that only illegals benefited is not supported by comprehensive evidence.)

3. Trump - “Inflation is killing our country, it’s absolutely killing us.” (True - While inflation can significantly impact the economy and individuals’ daily lives, the extent of its impact is subjective and can be debated; however, the statement is true in that inflation rates have been a concern for many voters.)

4. Trump - “First, though, the Supreme Court just approved the abortion pill. And I agree with the decision to have done that and I will not block it.” (False - This statement is inaccurate as it misrepresents Supreme Court decisions regarding medication abortion. The legal context surrounding abortion and medication varies and is complex.)

5. Trump - “I had the highest approval rating for veterans taking care of the VA. He has the worst.” (False - This claim is subjective and lacks specific data to verify approval ratings. While Trump has claimed high approval ratings, Harris' administration also has a complex record regarding veterans.)

6. Trump - “Our country is being destroyed as you and I sit up here and waste a lot of time in this debate.” (False - While opinions on the state of the nation vary, this statement is an exaggeration that lacks empirical support and is largely subjective.)

7. Trump - “We’re very, very close to World War 3 and he’s driving us there.” (False - This claim lacks concrete evidence and context. While tensions may exist internationally, asserting we are 'very close' to World War 3 is speculative and not grounded in an agreed-upon measure of proximity to such a conflict.)

8. Trump - “You sure you continue to use an appeals court which on across the country, one single court, humid setting a new clue shed any minute.” (False - The statement appears convoluted and its meaning unclear, leading to the inability to verify its truthfulness.)"
